##### Hi, my name is Marcel Szelwiga.
```ABOUT``` Some facts about me:
* I’m currently studying computer science (engineer's degree) at University of Wrocław.
* I started coding when I was 14 years old, and I was focused mainly on Competitive programming.
* Today I teach young talents, and prepare them to start in Olympiad of Informatics.
* I would like to code some small projects, but unfortunately lack of time during studies hurts.

```DONE``` Projects:
* Stormy - online drive command line client (```bash```, ```python```) + it's server api (```node```)
* Bashdio - terminal styled audio player on local website (```js```, ```html```)
* Galactica - game login screen with randomly generated pixelart space background (```js```)
* XIVLO - static website which covers topic for my students (```html```)

```AWARDS``` Competitive programming awards 
* Central European Regional Contest (CERC) | `15th place out of 56`
* Polish Collegiate Programming Contest (AMPPZ) | `bronze medal, 9th place out of 50`
* Polish Programming Championships for High School Students | `bronze medal, 3rd place (two times)`
* Polish Olympiad in Informatics | `silver medal, 7th place`

```TODO``` List of things i would like to code in near future:
